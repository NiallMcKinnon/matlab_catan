# matlab_catan
 Playable Catan in MATLAB!

 This was originally created for an intro to MATLAB course, but I am maintaining/improving it in order to keep a working knowldge of MATLAB syntax.

 Obviously this isn't a good example of MATLAB's use case. But it is a fun way to stay fluent in the language.
