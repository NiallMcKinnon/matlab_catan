# matlab_catan
Playable Catan in MATLAB!

This was originally a final project for an intro to MATLAB course, but I have come back to maintain it as a fun way to keep a working knowledge of MATLAB.

The original presented the map on a plot and had most of the interactivity through the console. I am working on building a new version that is entierly GUI-based.

For either the new or legacy versions, simply open catan.m and run the script.
